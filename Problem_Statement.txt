Problem Statement:

CISA in accordance with Executive Order 14028 and the Office of Management and Budgetâ€™s (OMB) guide in OMB M-22-18, Enhancing the Security of the Software Supply 
Chain through Secure Software Development Practices, released a draft Secure Software Development Attestation Common Form. Every business selling to the government
has to attest to secure software development for every major software release. Since the form has to be filled and signed for every major release of every software
product it would become tedious to manage. Additionally, different participants would be responsible for the confirmation for different sections of the form, 
it would become extremely difficult for coordination.

Solution: Build or find a solution which has capability to trigger the generation of the form for each release through an API, assign tasks to individuals responsible for 
the different sections of the form. Store the forms signed and shared already. 
 - Create the capability to register a trigger request for Self Attestation form
  - Match if there is already an existing attestation for the product+version number already existing
 - Based on the responsibles registered for each product the trigger request is then assigned to the responsible PPSSO
 - The PPSSO can then trigger the "flow",
   - The flow creation is also a feature required -> The steps are constant but can be assigned to different persons -> assigned by the PPSSO
 - Digital document signing (PDF) is a required feature
 - The storage of signed PDFs should be a feature, the PDFs are encrypted with the key by PPSSO
 - API support to trigger the flow, generation and signing of the forms from the CI/CD pipelines
 - Import of product names from API
