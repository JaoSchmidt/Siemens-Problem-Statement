				On behalf of the above-specified company, I attest that [software producer] presently makes
				consistent use of the following practices, derived from the secure software development
				framework (SSDF),4 in developing the software identified in Section I:
			</p>
			<p class="font-[600] text-md">
				1) The software is developed and built in secure environments. Those environments are secured
				by the following actions, at a minimum:	
			</p>
			<p class="font-[300] text-md">
				a) Separating and protecting each environment involved in developing and building
				software;
			</p>
			<p class="font-[300] text-md">
				b) Regularly logging, monitoring, and auditing trust relationships used for authorization and
				access:
			</p>
			<p class="font-[300] text-md">
				i) to any software development and build environments; and
			</p>
			<p class="font-[300] text-md">
				ii) among components within each environment;
			</p>
			<p class="font-[300] text-md">
				c) Enforcing multi-factor authentication and conditional access across the environments
				relevant to developing and building software in a manner that minimizes security risk;
			</p>
			<p class="font-[300] text-md">
				d) Taking consistent and reasonable steps to document, as well as minimize use or inclusion	
				of software products that create undue risk within the environments used to develop and
				build software;
			</p>
			<p class="font-[300] text-md">
				e) Encrypting sensitive data, such as credentials, to the extent practicable and based on risk;
			</p>
			<p class="font-[300] text-md">
				f) Implementing defensive cybersecurity practices, including continuous monitoring of
				operations and alerts and, as necessary, responding to suspected and confirmed cyber
				incidents;
			</p>
			<p class="font-[600] text-md">
				2) The software producer has made a good-faith effort to maintain trusted source code supply
				chains by employing automated tools or comparable processes to address the security of
				internal code and third-party components and manage related vulnerabilities;
			</p>
			<p class="font-[600] text-md">
				3) The software producer maintains provenance for internal code and third-party components
				incorporated into the software;
			</p>
			<p class="font-[600] text-md">
				4) The software producer employs automated tools or comparable processes that check for
				security vulnerabilities. In addition:
			</p>
			<p class="font-[300] text-md">
				a) The software producer operates these processes on an ongoing basis and, at a minimum,
				prior to product, version, or update releases;
			</p>
			<p class="font-[300] text-md">
				b) The software producer has a policy or process to address discovered security
				vulnerabilities prior to product release; and
			</p>
			<p class="font-[300] text-md">
				c) The software producer operates a vulnerability disclosure program and accepts, reviews,
				and addresses disclosed software vulnerabilities in a timely fashion and according to any
				timelines specified in the vulnerability disclosure program or applicable policies.
